# patternsof.design-scrape-and-usecase
## Use the patternsof.desgn website's 'rules' as a source for world building, map generation. and exploration.
The website pattern[patternsof.design](https://patternsof.design/) contains many rules, devised by some human about the 'ideal' way to 'live'.
**NOTE: I don't actually know anything about the why of this website, I was just really drawn to it and want to explore it without having to read all of it in one go.*

Using cHaTgPt and other 'ai' help (cause I can't be spending all the time to actually know what I'm doing...), scrape the information from this website, feed it as an LLM's knowledge base and use its data to play.

**Things I need to learn a little bit about to make this happen:**
- can you give an existing LLM a repo of information to base all of its knowledge on?
- can I still ask it to come up with code to help me follow through with this idea?
- Is there existing world building tools that use a 'wiki' style database to generate content?

*Hopes for using the data from this website:*
- generate visual maps using the 'rules' presented
- can it be useful in world building excercises for a 'solarpunk' style environment?
- - this could be usefull for procedurally generated content for interactive applications

enough for now...
